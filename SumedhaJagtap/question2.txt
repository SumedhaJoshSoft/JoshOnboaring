Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.
- The default local repository is origin and suppose we need to link the local repo to another multiple repo we can use following steps:
- To check all available remotes use following command:
   git remote -v
- To add new repo url to remoted use following command:
  git remote add foo git@github.com:SumedhaJoshSoft/Foo.git
    - foo is the alias for repo with url git@github.com:SumedhaJoshSoft/Foo.git
    - we can add multiple remotes with respective alias and urls using the above command
    - Also we can add single remote alias for multiple remotes
- We can restrict the remote for fetch/push by using following command

   git remote set-url [--push] <name> <newurl> [<oldurl>]
   or: git remote set-url --add <name> <newurl>
   or: git remote set-url --delete <name> <url>
